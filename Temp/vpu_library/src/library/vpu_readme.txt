o This example demonstrates the use of the VPU register and memory regions
  mapped to an address space
o To execute, build and run the 'vpu' project.
o Output is shown in Multi (IO pane) and/or serial console.
o Note that this example does not work on the iMX6 Solo/DualLite since it
  has no VPU block.

Note that this example only illustrates the VPU memory region mappings and
basic register area access from a Virtual Address Space. It contains no actual
video coding/encoding.
